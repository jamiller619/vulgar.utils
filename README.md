# @vulgar/utils

> A collection of personal utilities I use between projects.

### IMPORTANT

There is NO index.js file for this package, and the
package.json file does NOT contain a `"main"` entry, which
was intentional.

Instead, just import what you need directly:

```js
import fetchRetry from '@vulgar/utils/log'
```

## Install

```bash
yarn add @vulgar/utils
```

## Typescript

Made with Typescript, and includes types in the distributed
package by default.

## Documentation

Hence, Typescript.
